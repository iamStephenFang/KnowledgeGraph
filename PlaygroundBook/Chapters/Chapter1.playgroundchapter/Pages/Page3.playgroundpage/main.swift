//: # Create your Knowledge Graph
//: On this page, you will try to create a knowledge graph in the form of functions. Related operations have been encapsulated by functions, please refer to the following steps to write your code to fill the blank knowledge graph.
//:
//: ### Step One
//: The first step is to create an **Entity** object, be sure to give it a text identifier, such as 'Apple', then use function `graph.addEntity()` or `graph.addEntities()` to add your entity to the graph, the latter will add entities in the form of an array.
//: ### Step Two
//: The second step is to create **Relation** objects by calling function `graph.addRelation()`, the parameters accepted by this function are the first Entity, the second Entity, and the name of the relation. If you have written a long piece of code and want to change one of the relation, you can call the function `graph.updateRelation()` to update. The parameters accepted by the two functions are the same.
//: ### Step Three
//: The position of **Relation** in the graph is randomly generated from the position of the established **Entity**. If you are not satisfied with the position of the entity, you can change its position by dragging. If you decide to delete an Entity, you can call the function `graph.deleteEntity()` to delete it, this function will delete all relations related to the entity.

 * callout(
 Precautions):
The newly created entity appears in the middle of the screen by default, which means if you do not create a relation for the created entity, the entity will remain in the middle of the graph.
