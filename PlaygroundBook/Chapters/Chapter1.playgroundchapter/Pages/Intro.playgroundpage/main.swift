//: # Introduction to Knowledge Graph
//: Welcome to *A Tour In Knowledge Graph*, in this swift playground, you will learn the basic ideas about knowledge graph.

//: ## What is a Knowledge Graph?
//: The knowledge graph represents a collection of interlinked descriptions of entities – real-world objects and events, situations or abstract concepts.
//: A knowledge graph can be simply understood as a multi-relational graph, i.e., a graph containing multiple types of nodes and multiple types of edges.
//:
//: ### Storage methods of Knowledge Graph
//: **RDF** RDF stands for Resource Description Framework and it’s a W3C standard for data exchange in the Web. RDF consists of nodes and edges. Nodes represent entities and resources, attributes, while edges represent the relationship between entities and entities, as well as the relationship between entities and attributes.
//:
//: **Graph Database** Graph database is a database that uses graph structure for semantic query, which uses nodes, edges and attributes to represent and store data. The key concept of the system is graph, which directly associates the data items in storage with the set of edges that represent the relationship between data nodes and nodes.
