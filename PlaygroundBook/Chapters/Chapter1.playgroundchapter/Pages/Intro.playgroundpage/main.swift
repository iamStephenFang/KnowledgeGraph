//: # Introduction to Knowledge Graph
//: Welcome to *First Taste of Knowledge Graph*, in the next few minutes you will learn some basic ideas about knowledge graph.
//:
//: Before entering the playground, I want you to think about the difference between **Information** and **Knowledge**.
//: - - -
//: ## The difference between Information And Knowledge
//: You can find a visual answer on the right side. Brifely speaking, knowledge can be achieved by establishing the relationship between entities on the basis of information. The entities are usually the real-world objects, events, situations or abstract concepts.
//:
//: Now that you know the difference between information and knowledge, I believe that you can understand knowledge graph as well.
//: - - -
//: ## What is the Knowledge Graph?
//: The knowledge graph represents a collection of interlinked descriptions of entities. A knowledge graph can be simply understood as a multi-relational graph, i.e., a graph containing multiple types of nodes and multiple types of edges.
//:
//: ## What will learn from the book?
//: * [Chapter One](Basic%20Structure) will let you understand the basic structure of knowledge graph.
//: * [Chapter Two](Example%20Graph) will allows you to play with a interactive knowledge graph.
//: * [Chapter Three](Create%20Your%20Graph) will guide you how to create a knowledge graph in the form of functions.
//: * [Chapter Four](Q&A%20System) will demonstrate the application of knowledge graph in different fields.
