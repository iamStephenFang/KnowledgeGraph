//: ### Storage methods of Knowledge Graph
//: To help you understand the knowledge graph in a simple way, a basic simulation of the structure of the knowledge graph is given in this Playground. In real scenarios, there are several main ways to store the knowledge graph.
//:
//: **RDF** RDF stands for Resource Description Framework and it’s a W3C standard for data exchange in the Web. RDF consists of nodes and edges. Nodes represent entities and resources, attributes, while edges represent the relationship between entities and entities, as well as the relationship between entities and attributes.
//:
//: **Graph Database** Graph database is a database that uses graph structure for semantic query, which uses nodes, edges and attributes to represent and store data. The key concept of the system is graph, which directly associates the data items in storage with the set of edges that represent the relationship between data nodes and nodes.
