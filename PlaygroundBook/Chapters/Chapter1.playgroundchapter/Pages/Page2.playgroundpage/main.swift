//: # A Knowledge Graph about countries
//: When you select and drag on an entity in the knowledge graph on the right, you can see all the **Relation** information related to the **Entity** you have selected from the top of the view, and of course, you can zoom in and out the knowledge graph as well.
//:
//: Suppose you want to know the capital of China, through the triplet "China-Capital-Beijing" you can easily get the answer to the question with other entities information related to Beijing, it is similar to the behavior when you search for the capital of China in the online search engine. In fact, many search engines use knowledge graph-related techniques.
//: ## Storage methods of Knowledge Graph
//: To help you understand the knowledge graph in a easy way, a basic simulation of the structure of the knowledge graph is given in this playground. In the actual production environment, there are two main methods to store the knowledge graph.
//:
//: **RDF** RDF stands for Resource Description Framework and it’s a W3C standard for data exchange in the Web. RDF consists of nodes and edges. Nodes represent entities and resources, attributes, while edges represent the relationship between entities and entities, as well as the relationship between entities and attributes.
//:
//: **Graph Database** Graph database is a database that uses graph structure for semantic query, which uses nodes, edges and attributes to represent and store data. The key concept of the system is graph, which directly associates the data items in storage with the set of edges that represent the relationship between data nodes and nodes.

//: After experiencing the knowledge graph, why not try to create a knowledge graph on your own?
