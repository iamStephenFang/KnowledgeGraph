//: # Simple Q&A System
//: There are scenarios in which the Knowledge Graph is used in many areas, currently in search engines, intelligent Q&A, big data analytics, language translation and language understanding, and Internet of Things.
//:
//: The liveView simulates a simple Q&A system scenario, and as you may have guessed, indeed, the answers to these questions are extracted from the knowledge graph just created.
//:
//: A real-life knowledge graph would have much more complex logic to deal with, and would require a surprisingly large amount of data to process, and could also be combined with artificial intelligence techniques. If you are interested in knowledge graphs, you can learn more about knowledge graphs from the web.
//: ### Disclaimer:
//: Some of the code was inspired by, and modified from, a tutorial written by Warren Burton on the Raywenderlich website.
//:
//: The design of “First Taste of Knowledge Graph” playground was done by Stephen Fang (Xuanmiao Fang).
